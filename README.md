# Shopify App Starter Using Apollo, Nextjs, and Tailwind

This is a boilerplate created from the official boilerplate using the Shopify [Shopify-App-CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-cli) but with functional components and hooks using @apollo/client instead of apollo-boost. It is set up to use with Polaris, but also is configured for tailwind for anything not possible through Polaris.

## Installation

Fork and clone repo.
Run npm install.

## Requirements
